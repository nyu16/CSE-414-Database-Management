The whole concept of DBMS comes from storing, retrieving, and running different query commands. As for MS Azure, I haven’t had an opinion before, but now I’m having some thoughts. First thought revolved around efficiency. I have used both the database that we have made during out second assignment and this one. Azure proved to be more efficient in that we could save our works and load the data from different devices as long as we had internet connection. It crossed my mind that if I were to work on a project with many other group members, MS Azure would prove to be very powerful. On the other hand, I found using the local database to be faster than the online one at times; as the matter of fact, I couldn’t run the results for question 4, while I succeeded with my local database in my computer. Depending on server conditions, MS Azure showed its limits. There showed clear pros and cons. The second thought revolved around security. I believe MS Azure would have a firm firewall. However, it made me think how safe database could be once it is exposed as public cloud service - probably not too much.
